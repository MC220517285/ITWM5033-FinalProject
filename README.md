	# Task 3: Continuous Integration (CI) Setup (20 points)
	# •	Choose a CI/CD platform (e.g., Jenkins, Travis CI, GitHub Actions).
	# •	Set up a CI pipeline that triggers on code pushes.
	# •	Configure the pipeline to build and test your Dockerized application.
	# •	Ensure that the CI pipeline reports test results and code quality metrics.
	# Task 8: Documentation and Presentation (10 points)
	# •	Create comprehensive documentation for your DevOps pipeline, including setup instructions, pipeline architecture, and troubleshooting guides.
